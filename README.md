# Zora 95 Open-Source
After almost a year of being out, Zora 95 still remains as the program that officially marked the biggest steppingstone in my career as a programmer: creating programs with GUIs

This was huge to me abck then, as at the time, everyone I knew really only made command-line programs, and at the time, `MSI Suite` was the best program that I made as it was modular, and fancy; that was until 95 came.

**I cannot thank enough the people who supported both my passion project and I, you guys really made me continue to push forward in order to actually accomplish my dream of making an OS-like program**

# What's the future for Zora?

As November 6th approaches, I will continue to give occasional updates to both 95 and DS, however the new, definitive Zora now, is **ZoraNT**

If you would like to support me so that i can continue to maintain Zora and other open-source projects of mine, please consider donating, or maybe even spreading the word, anything helps!

Again, I cannot thank enough my friends who encouraged me throughout the journey, hope you'll like NT when it releases!
